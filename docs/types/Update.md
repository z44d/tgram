##‚öôÔ∏è Properties

- **`update_id`** (**`int`** ): **The update's unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain positive number and
increase sequentially. This ID becomes especially handy if you're using webhooks, since it allows you to ignore
repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of order. If there are no new updates
for at least a week, then identifier of the next update will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially.**
