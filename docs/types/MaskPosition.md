#🔮 MaskPosition

**This object describes the position on faces where a mask should be placed by default.**

##⚙️ Properties

- **`point`** (**`str`** ): **The part of the face relative to which the mask should be placed. One of “forehead”, “eyes”, “mouth”, or
“chin”.**
- **`x_shift`** (**`float`** ): **Shift by X-axis measured in widths of the mask scaled to the face size, from left to right. For example,
choosing -1.0 will place mask just to the left of the default mask position.**
- **`y_shift`** (**`float`** ): **Shift by Y-axis measured in heights of the mask scaled to the face size, from top to bottom. For
example, 1.0 will place the mask just below the default mask position.**
- **`scale`** (**`float`** ): **Mask scaling coefficient. For example, 2.0 means double size.**
